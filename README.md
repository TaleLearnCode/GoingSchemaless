# Going Schema-less: How to migrate a relational database to a NoSQL database
![Going Schema-less: How to migrate a relational database to a NoSQL database](https://chadgreen.blob.core.windows.net/slides/GoingSchemaless.jpg)

## Abstract
There can be a lot of great benefits of developing with a NoSQL database over a relational database. In this presentation, you will learn about those benefits and also the potential pitfalls.  There will be demonstrations where we take relationally developed data, restructure it into a NoSQL database (Cosmos DB in particular), and create an application to work with that data.

## Elevator Pitch
Learn about the benefits and pitfalls of moving data from a relational data model to a NoSQL data model with demonstrations using Cosmos DB and .NET backends.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn about the pros and cons of developing with a NoSQL data model over a relational data model
- Learn how to migrate data from a relational data model to a NoSQL data model
- Learn how to develop a .NET application to use a Cosmos DB NoSQL data model
